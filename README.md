SDG 16.1 Significantly Reduce All Forms of Violence and Related Death Rates Everywhere

Project Scenario:

In a world riddled with various forms of violence and alarming death rates, this project aims to create a comprehensive strategy to significantly reduce violence across different contexts, especially domestic violence. In 2020 alone, 47,000 women and girls were killed by their own family members or intimate partners. This means that, on average, a woman or girl lost her life every 11 minutes to gender-based violence. The focus is on understanding, addressing, and preventing domestic violence occurrences in the context of gender-based violence. Domestic violence takes many more forms than physical blows or wounds. It includes sexual violence, verbal violence, emotional violence and financial violence. All these kinds of violence are happening at home.
